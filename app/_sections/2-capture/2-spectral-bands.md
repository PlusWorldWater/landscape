# Spectral Bands.

---

Many modern satellites collect infrared and ultraviolet light not visible to the human eye. This information can be used to measure vegetation health, to monitor biomass, or to track forest fires. Newer laser and Radar-based sensors precisely scan the earth, eliminating weather dependencies, producing 3D earth models, and enabling better change detection.

In this imagery over rural Uganda, near-infrared sensors augment imagery to highlight vegetation (False Color) and to measure the health of that vegetation (NDVI). These images show a range of imagery resolutions from different growing seasons.
