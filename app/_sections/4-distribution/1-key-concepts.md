{% include side-image.html definition="Over 60% of the Earth is covered by clouds at any moment, so imaging a large area often involves combining multiple scenes." image="mosaic_icon.svg" solution="mosiacs" %}

- Mosaics blend together imagery from multiple scenes into a single, seamless image. E.g. _DigitalGlobe Vivid+_, _Planet Labs seasonal mosaics_

- Large image files are cumbersome to download, and hard to use on the web
_Solution: Hosted imagery and mosaics_

- Hosted imagery and mosaics are tiled basemaps that can be easily integrated into web applications _E.g. Astro Digital Fetch_

- Massive datasets and intensive analysis are difficult to preform on client software
_Solution: Cloud hosting and analytics_
