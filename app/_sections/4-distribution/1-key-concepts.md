{% include side-image.html definition="Imagery has clouds. And looking at a large area involves multiple scenes that usually don't match up well." image="mosaic_icon.svg" solution="mosiacs" %}

- Mosaics blend together imagery from multiple scenes into a single, cloudfree seam-less image. E.g. DigitalGlobe Vivid+, _Planet Labs seasonal mosaics_

- Large image files are hard to use on the web
_Solution: Hosted imagery and mosaics_

- Hosted imagery and mosaics are tiled basemaps that can be easily integrated into web applications _E.g. Astro Digital Fetch_

- Massive datasets and intensive analysis are difficult to preform on client software
_Solution: Cloud Hosting and Analytics_
