# Key Concepts

---

### Mosaics 

- Large image files are cumbersome to download, and hard to use on the web so imagery is often tiled into smaller pieces that can be individually handled.

- Over 60% of the Earth is covered by clouds at any moment, so imaging a large area often involves combining multiple scenes, sometimes from different days or even from different sources.

- Mosaics blend together imagery from multiple scenes into a single, seamless image. E.g. _DigitalGlobe Vivid+_, _Planet Labs seasonal mosaics_.

### Hosted Imagery

- Hosted imagery and mosaics are tiled basemaps can be easily integrated into web applications _E.g. Astro Digital Fetch_.

- Hosted imagery combined with server side analytics can also greatly speed up intensive analytics on a large scale. 

- Cloud hosting and Analytics services allow users to run heavy computation across many images, and only download the end product _E.g. Landsat on AWS, Google Earth Engine_

### Image Catalogs and Searching

- Large organizations may have trouble tracking imagery purchased by different units or for different projects _Solution: Hosted catalogs_

- Hosted catalogs allow users across an organization to browse and re-download any imagery they've previously purchased _E.g. Airbus DataDoors_

- Searching across multiple imagery provider archives is difficult and time consuming _Solution: Unified search platforms_

- Unified search platforms provide results from multiple vendors and platforms, allowing the best available option to be chosen. _E.g. DigitalGlobe Unified Commercial platform_
