# Additional Concepts

---

- Cloud Hosting and Analytics services allow users to run heavy computation across many images and only download the end product _E.g. Landsat on AWS, Google Earth Engine_

- Large organizations may have trouble tracking imagery purchased by different units or for different projects _Solution: Hosted catalogs_

Hosted catalogs allow users across an organization to browse and re-download any imagery you've already purchased _E.g. Airbus DataDoors_

Searching across the archives of multiple imagery providers is hard and time consuming _Solution: Unified search platforms_

Unified search platforms provide results from multiple vendors and platforms, allowing choice of best available option. _E.g. DigitalGlobe Unified Commercial platform_
